    <h1>Loops</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Loops</b> allow us to repeat code over and over again.
        There are multiple types of loops.
    </p>
    <h2>Classic for loop</h2>
    <p>
        <b>For loops</b> allow us to repeat code a set number of times. And that time is usually based on the condition.<br/>
        <i><br/>
            const names = ["Mark", "Sarah", "Ebony"];<br/>
            <br/>
            // So you have your <b>initialization</b>, you have your <b>condition</b>, and then you have your <b>increment</b><br/>
            for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {<br/>
            console.log(names[i]); // 0, 1, 2<br/>
            }<br/>
        </i><br/>
        For loop is best suited for cases when exactly how many times it should execute is known.<br/>
    </p>
    <h2>While loops</h2>
    <p>
        A <b>while loop</b> starts with the <i>while</i> keyword. After you type the while keyword, then you put parentheses ().<br/>
        Inside the parentheses, you put the <b>condition</b> in which to keep running the loop.<br/>
        So this means, <b>as long as the condition is true, the loop will continue</b>.<br/>
        <i><br/>
            let password = "tomorrow";<br/>
            let userGuess = "";<br/>
            <br/>
            while (userGuess !== password) {<br/>
            userGuess = prompt("Please enter your password");<br/>
            }<br/>
            <br/>
            alert("Login Successful");<br/>
        </i><br/>
        While loop is best suited for cases when exactly how many times it should execute is unknown.<br/>
    </p>
    <h2>Do while loops</h2>
    <p>
        Do this while something happens.<br/>
        <b>Do while loop</b> is best suited for cases when you need to run the loop body at least once.<br/>
        <br/>
        The important difference is that the <b>do while loop will run at least once</b>, <br/>
        whereas with the while loop, there's no guarantee that it will run at least once as long as condition is false.<br/>
        <i><br/>
            let factorial = 1;<br/>
            let number = 5;<br/>
            let original = number;<br/>
            <br/>
            do {<br/>
                factorial = factorial * number;<br/>
                number--<br/>
            } while (number > 0);<br/>
        </i>
