    <h1>Variables in JavaScript</h1>
    <p> In JavaScript, you have three ways to declare a variable:
        <ol>
        <li>the <b>let</b> keyword</li>
        <li>use the <b>const</b> keyword</li>
        <li>you also have access to the <b>var</b> keyword</li>
        </ol>
        Now, we don't really use <b>var</b> as much before because that's more of a legacy feature for JavaScript. <br/>
        <b>var</b> has some very different rules than let and const.<br/>
        <br/>
        <b>let</b> allows you to create a variable, but reassign the value, <br/>
        <br/>
        whereas <b>const</b> - when you create a variable, you actually can't reassign that value.
    </p>
    <h1>JavaScript Data Types</h1>
    <p>
        JavaScript has the concept of primitive data types: strings, numbers, boolean and undefined/null.<br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Strings</b> are letters, numbers, emojis, and any type of character you see on the keyboard.<br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Numbers</b> can be positive, negative whole numbers, or even be numbers with decimals.<br/>
        Numbers are great because you can do basic operations on them like add, subtract, multiply, divide.<br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Boolean</b> - the boolean type is strictly true or false.<br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Undefined</b> usually means that there is no value. <br/>
        If I created a new variable without assigning an initial value, I'll have undefined. <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Null</b> usually means that we are clearing out the value. <br/>
        If a variable is set to null that usually means that we're saying it doesn't have a value.<br/>
